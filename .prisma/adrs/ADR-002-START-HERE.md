# ADR-002: START HERE 🚀

**Quick Navigation Guide**

---

## What Happened?

We discovered that **6 out of 8 phases** of `cli-unification-ux-improvement` were already implemented in previous commits, but we started re-implementing Phase 1, wasting development time.

**Current branch** `phase-1/remove-dead-code` contains **-292 LOC** that were already removed in commit `ad2842c` (which removed -2,115 LOC total).

---

## The Decision

**Option D: Pre-Flight Validation + Strategic Reset**

1. Discard current branch (redundant work)
2. Create mandatory pre-flight validation process
3. Audit all specifications
4. Document lessons learned
5. Start next implementation with validated GO

**Investment:** 4 hours
**ROI:** 400-900% (prevents 20-40h of duplicate work)

## Quick Answers to Common Questions

### Q: Why discard the current branch?
A: It contains -292 LOC already removed in commit ad2842c. Merging would duplicate work and pollute git history.

### Q: How much time will this take?
A: 4 hours total for complete setup. But you can start with Phase 1 (5 min) and Phase 2 (1h) today.

### Q: What's the ROI?
A: 400-900%. Prevents 20-40 hours of duplicate work over next quarter. Payback in 1 week.

### Q: Can we skip the pre-flight process?
A: No. This is now MANDATORY for all spec-driven work. Exceptions only for new features, prototypes, or hotfixes.

### Q: What if other specs are also complete?
A: Great! Audit will reveal that. We'll celebrate progress and focus on truly new work.

### Q: Will the pre-flight script have false positives?
A: Possibly 5% rate, but that's acceptable. Better than current 100% false negative rate (missed duplication).

```
🚨 IMPORTANT: New Development Process

We discovered duplicate work (Phase 1 of cli-unification was already done).
To prevent this, we're implementing mandatory pre-flight checks.

ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Read: .prisma/adrs/ADR-002-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md
2. Phase 1 starts today: Discard phase-1/remove-dead-code branch
3. Phase 2-3 this week: Create validation process

Questions? Ping Tech Lead or review ADR-002-START-HERE.md
```

### For Management (Summary)

```
DECISION: Implementing Pre-Flight Validation Process

CONTEXT: Discovered 6/8 phases of spec already implemented, but restarted work.

SOLUTION: Mandatory validation before starting any spec phase.

INVESTMENT: 4 hours
RETURN: Prevents 20-40h duplicate work (ROI 400-900%)

APPROVAL NEEDED: Option D in ADR-002-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md

Next step after approval: Team executes 5-phase plan this week.

## Next Review

**Date:** 2025-11-15 (1 month from now)

**Agenda:**
- Did we prevent duplicate work? (Success metric)
- Is pre-flight adopted 100%? (Process metric)
- Has velocity improved? (Performance metric)
- Any process refinements needed? (Iteration)

---

## Final Note

**This is a learning opportunity, not a failure.**

The discovery that work was duplicated is valuable. The process we're creating from this experience will save exponentially more time than was lost.

**Measure twice, cut once.** That's what pre-flight checks are about.

**NEXT STEP:** Read the document that matches your role (see Decision Matrix above)
